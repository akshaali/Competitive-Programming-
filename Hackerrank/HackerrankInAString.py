"""
We say that a string contains the word hackerrank if a subsequence of its characters spell the word hackerrank. For example, if string  it does contain hackerrank, but  does not. In the second case, the second r is missing. If we reorder the first string as , it no longer contains the subsequence due to ordering.

More formally, let  be the respective indices of h, a, c, k, e, r, r, a, n, k in string . If  is true, then  contains hackerrank.

For each query, print YES on a new line if the string contains hackerrank, otherwise, print NO.
