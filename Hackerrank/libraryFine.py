"""
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: .
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, .
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the .
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of .
Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be .

Function Description

Complete the libraryFine function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the fine due.

libraryFine has the following parameter(s):

d1, m1, y1: returned date day, month and year
d2, m2, y2: due date day, month and year
Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers, , denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was returned.
The second line contains  space-separated integers, , denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was due to be returned.

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.
